ðŸ“§ AI-Based Gmail Email Generator
The AI-Based Gmail Email Generator is a smart web application that helps users generate professional, context-aware email content with minimal input. Whether you're writing a job application, a follow-up, a business inquiry, or an apology, this tool uses artificial intelligence to draft a relevant and well-structured email based on your chosen tone and purpose.

Built with a lightweight HTML/CSS frontend and powered by a Python Flask backend, the app integrates with leading AI text generation APIs like Cohere or OpenAI. The user interface allows users to select the email type, define the recipient role, describe the emailâ€™s purpose, and choose the appropriate tone (e.g., formal, friendly, professional). With one click, the AI engine generates a personalized email, which can be copied to the clipboard and used immediately.

ðŸ”§ How It Works
The app gathers four inputs from the user:

Email Type (Job Application, Apology, etc.)

Recipient Role (e.g., Hiring Manager)

Purpose or Context (e.g., applying for a backend developer role)

Tone (Formal, Polite, Friendly, etc.)

These inputs are sent to the Flask backend, which constructs a natural language prompt and sends it to an AI model (via Cohere or OpenAI API). The returned email content is then displayed on the frontend and can be copied with a single click.
